# [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) sequence algorithm with [Memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) usage.

**Fibonacci numbers** are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence,
and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding.
**Memoisation** is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive 
function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
